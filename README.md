# DCGANs_Infected_SI_joint_Images
Using DCGANs to generate X-ray images of Sacroiliac joints infected by some kind of arthiritis. 
This is still work in progress.

I have less than 70 ground truth samples. I had to augment the data-set by replication and data-generator. The quality of the images generated are not of the highest quality yet. This is still `work in progress`.

# DCGANs_Infected_SI_joint_Images
Using DCGANs to generate X-ray images of Sacroiliac joints infected by _Ankylosing Spondylitits_. 
This is still work in progress.

This project is particularly useful because it generates images of infected SI joints in the body. One more aspect that makes this project standout is the fact that the DCGANs genereated quality images of infected SI joints from a very small number of images in other words the corpus of images used was not huge and had to be augmented in various ways along with various manipulations in the operational parameters of the DCGAN. The quality of the images generated are not of the highest quality yet with more data and different manupulations in the parameters of the DCGAN I hope to get better quality images in the near future.
